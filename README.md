# Import is Important Tutorial

## Animal Classification Project

This project is designed to provide practice with the following skills:

- Designing package structures
- Managing imports in a moderately complex package structure
- Understanding the difference between different types of imports
- Understanding namespaces
- Troubleshooting import errors and exceptions, including `NameError`, `AttributeError`, `ModuleNotFoundError`, and `ImportError`

## Project Topic

You will be creating a package and module structure for an Animal Classification system. You'll start with an executable script and a few starter modules in a flat structure. Your goal is to create a package structure that follows the Animal Classification System pictured below:


## Requirements

- Do not change the code in the starter script (TODO: put name of script here) or the provided modules. Your package and module structure must respect the types of imports that already exist in the starter files.
- When run, the starter script will print out the Animal Classification
- Your structure and any code you write must correctly answer the Animal Classification Queries in the next section
- You may need to add more files and folders, including using `__init__.py` files where necessary
- there's no one right answer or best structure. Be prepared to justify why you made some of your design choices

## Animal Classification Queries

- Is an eagle warm blooded? (Answer: Yes)
- How does a frog breathe? (Answer: through skin)
- TODO: more
